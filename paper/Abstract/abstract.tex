\textit{Climate Change} topic has become more and more popular over the last years. 
Studies have shown, that public perception of climate changes increased recently \cite{publicperception}. 
Educational programs like \textit{Climate Reality Project} or \textit{NASA Global Climate Change} have played a significant role in raising awareness about climate change and its potential impact, thus contributing to efforts aimed at promoting environmentally conscious behavior and practices.
One of the most influential organization is UNESCO, that participates in this initiative by launching Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development program.

The main puprose of this dissertation is to understand trends in the temperature changes over the last hundred years and to use Machine Learning for temperate prediction.
The analysis and ML experiments are based on open sourced datasets published by Berkeley Earth and Our World in Data organizations.


The first part of the study focuses on understanding data and on using statistics to provide further insights.
Second part applies various Machine Learning algorithms for temperature prediction.
