\textit{Climate Change} topic has become more and more popular over the last years. 
Studies have shown, that public perception of climate changes increased recently \cite{publicperception} also thanks to various education programs.
One of the most influential organization is UNESCO, that participates in this initiative by launching Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development program.

The main puprose of this dissertation is to understand trends in the temperate changes over the last hundred years and to use Machine Learning for temperate prediction in the future.
The analysis and ML experiments are based on open sourced datasets published by Berkeley Earth and Our World in Data organizations.


The first part of the study focuses on understanding data and on using statistics to provide more insights.
Second part applies various Machine Learning algorithms for temperature prediction.
